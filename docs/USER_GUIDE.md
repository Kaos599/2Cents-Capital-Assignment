## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

#### Q: How accurate are these calculations?
**A**: The calculations use proven financial formulas and are mathematically accurate based on your inputs. However, they're projections based on assumptions about future returns and consistent savings.

#### Q: Can I save my results?
**A**: Currently, results are stored in your browser session. Take screenshots or notes of important information before closing the browser.

#### Q: What if I make a mistake in my profile?
**A**: Use the "Start Over" button in the sidebar to reset everything and begin again with correct information.

### Technical Questions

#### Q: Why do I need to provide my age?
**A**: Age determines how many years you have to save and grow your investments. This is crucial for compound interest calculations.

#### Q: What's the difference between nominal and real value?
**A**: Nominal value is the actual dollar amount. Real value is adjusted for inflation to show purchasing power in today's dollars.
